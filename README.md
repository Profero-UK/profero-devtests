# Profeo London: Technology Tests #

This GitHub repository contains the tests, assets and instructions for various technologies.

## General Instructions ##

### Retreaving a Test ###

You should have been informed which technology tests (at which level) are required, and which to submit.

You should download the <kbd>&lt;</kbd></kbd>technology<kbd>&gt;</kbd>\_<kbd>&lt;</kbd>level<kbd>&gt;</kbd>.zip as instructed,
e.g: js\_junior.zip to get each test individually to avoid downloading all the tests, zips and source in one go.

### Repository Structure  ###

The repository is organised by technology, then test level, each test level contains a zip file that
has all of the files required for the tests at that level, and includes the test instructions. 

	js/
		|_ junior/
			|_ test1
				|_ <various files>
				|_ README.md
			|_ test2
				|_ <various files>
				|_ README.md
			|_ js_junior.zip <-- Just download this file
		|_ mid-weight/
		|_ senior/
			
### Submission Format ###

Tests should be submitted in zip file format. Each technology tested should be compressed 
into a single file. The layout zip file should contains sub folders for each test, and 
each folder should be self-contained and contain any required code, assets and files.

Files should be named using the following format: <kbd>&lt;</kbd>last name<kbd>&gt;</kbd>\_<kbd>&lt;</kbd>first name<kbd>&gt;</kbd>_<kbd>&lt;</kbd>technology<kbd>&gt;</kbd>\_<kbd>&lt;</kbd>level<kbd>&gt;</kbd>.zip, 
i.e bloggs\_joe\_js\_junior.zip.

Zips can either be emailed to your recruiter, representive or directly to Profero, depending 
on how you've been engaged, again these instuctions should have been provided at your original 
engagement.

Each file should also contain a README.md file that outlines how 
the test was achieved, and outlines approaches, considerations and time taken. 
We use GitHub flavoured MarkDown, more info can be found here:
