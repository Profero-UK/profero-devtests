# JavaScript // Mid Weight Developer // Test 1 #

### Test Overview ###

Implement the functions outlined in index.html using the script.js file for your implementations.

#### OO Javascript ####

Firstly you'll need to implement a JavaScript class (using vanilla JavaScript only), that 
allows the following code to work:

	var dog = new Dog( "Fido" );
	console.log( dog.speak() );
	
The Dog class should expect a name variable when instatiating the object, it should store this value
and should also implement a 'speak' function that returns a string saying "Woof! My Name is: <name>" 
e.g: "Woof! My Name is: Fido"

#### Algorithms ####

Secondly, you'll need to implement a JavaScript sort method (again using vanilla JavaScript only),
that sorts an array into numerical order.

The function 'sortArray' has already been implemented in the script.js file, the task is to complete 
this function so that the array is properly sorted and returned.

### Bonus Points ###

* Use a design pattern, and identify why you used it
* JSDoc compliant documentation
* Use a recursive sorting method

### Expected Response ###

You should provide 2 source files, index.html & script.js, as well as a README.md file outlining your approach.
